= Guided Solution
:experimental:

== Objectives

* Investigate why logging into web ui shows error and satellite becomes unresponsive occasionally in Red Hat Satellite 6.
* Investigate why candlepin is down.
* Investigate why widgets on Satellite web ui are not loading.
* Solve the functionality and performance issues in the hands-on lab environment.

== Instructions

Run following instructions on `satellite` system with `root` as user.

.Sample output:
----
[ec2-user@satellite ~]$ sudo su -
[root@satellite ~]#
----

. Run the `hammer ping` command.
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
hammer ping
----
+
.Sample output:
----
candlepin:
    Status:          FAIL
    Server Response: Message: Failed to open TCP connection to localhost:23443 (Connection refused - connect(2) for "localhost" port 23443)
candlepin_auth:
    Status:          FAIL
    Server Response: Message: A backend service [ Candlepin ] is unreachable
candlepin_events:
    Status:          FAIL
    message:         Not running
----

. Logging into satellite web ui, results with following error:
+
image::login.png[login,100%,100%,link=self,window=_blank]
 Tip: click on the image to open in a new tab for better visibility

. Run the `satellite-maintain service restart` command to fix the login issue and to bring up candlepin.
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
satellite-maintain service restart
----

. But now widgets on `satellite web ui` (the page presented after logging into satellite web ui) are not loading properly.
+
image::widget.png[widget,100%,100%,link=self,window=_blank]

. The `/var/log/foreman/production.log` file indicates issue with making connections to db as well.
+
.Sample Output:
----
[root@satellite ~]# cat /var/log/foreman/production.log | grep FATAL | head -1
 8665e885 | ActiveRecord::ConnectionNotEstablished (FATAL:  remaining connection slots are reserved for non-replication superuser connections
----

. Review the parameters in `/etc/foreman-installer/scenarios.d/satellite-answers.yaml` and notice that the following parameters are misconfigured:
+
----
   foreman_foreman_service_puma_threads_min: 300
   foreman_foreman_service_puma_threads_max: 300
   foreman_foreman_service_puma_workers: 120
   db_pool: 300
   pulpcore_worker_count: 10
----

. According to official Red Hat documentation for performance tuning of Satellite 6.15 for a system with 64GB RAM and 8 VCPUs you should have:
.. medium tuning profile should be selected
.. Recommended Puma Threads for both min & max is 16
.. Recommended Puma Workers is 8 – 12
.. Value for pulpcore worker should be max 8
.. The effective value of $db_pool is automatically set to equal $foreman::foreman_service_puma_threads_max

. Combining the above we may run:
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
satellite-installer --foreman-foreman-service-puma-threads-min=16 --foreman-foreman-service-puma-threads-max=16 --foreman-foreman-service-puma-workers=12 --foreman-db-pool=16 --foreman-proxy-content-pulpcore-worker-count=8 --tuning medium
----

. Run `satellite-maintain service restart` command to reflect the changes.
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
satellite-maintain service restart
----
+
.Sample Output:

Running Restart Services
================================================================================
Check if command is run as root user:                                 [OK]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Restart applicable services:

Restarting the following service(s):
redis, postgresql, pulpcore-api, pulpcore-content, pulpcore-worker@1.service, pulpcore-worker@2.service, pulpcore-worker@3.service, pulpcore-worker@4.service, pulpcore-worker@5.service, pulpcore-worker@6.service, pulpcore-worker@7.service, pulpcore-worker@8.service, tomcat, dynflow-sidekiq@orchestrator, foreman, httpd, dynflow-sidekiq@worker-1, dynflow-sidekiq@worker-hosts-queue-1, foreman-proxy
| All services restarted                                              [OK]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----

. Now you should be able to see all widgets.
Run `hammer ping` command to verify it.
